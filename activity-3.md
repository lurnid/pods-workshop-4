# W4 Workshop activity 3: Evaluating your models

**In this workshop activity, you'll compute metrics to evaluate your models.**

For your models, compute the following metrics:

- accuracy
- precision
- recall
- f1-score

You can compute all of these at once using `classification_report` from `sklearn.metrics`.

### Extension activity: Creating a confusion matrix

Construct a confusion matrix using:

`confusion_matrix` and `ConfusionMatrixDisplay` from `sklearn.metrics`
